Dots Connector
===

A fast 2D [Delaunay Triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation) TypeScript library.
It works in modern browser and NodeJS environments.

- [Interactive Demo](https://stnguyen.github.io/dots-connector/)
- This library is an implementation of [A simple sweep-line Delaunay triangulation algorithm, 2013, Liu Yonghe, Feng Jinming and Shao Yuehong](http://www.academicpub.org/jao/paperInfo.aspx?paperid=15630) paper.

The library is still a *work in progress*. If you need a fast, feature-rich library, use [delaunator](https://github.com/mapbox/delaunator) instead.
